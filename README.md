# The Distribution of Social Housing in Paris
This repository contains the HTML, Javascript, CSS, and relevant data for [this interactive web map](https://sarahhahmad.github.io/final-assignment-advgis/) which shows the distribution of the social housing stock in the arrondissements of Paris and Social Housing Deficit Zones.  

This map is based on the data and static maps from [Apur: L'atelier parisien d'urbanisme (Paris Urban Agency)](https://www.apur.org/fr), specifically the [Map of social housing in Paris - Situation on 1st January 2019](https://www.apur.org/en/our-works/map-social-housing-paris-situation-1st-january-2019)

# About this Map
When the website is initially loaded, users can see the Distribution of Social Housing choropleth and a sidebar that describes the function of the map, how users can interact with it, and why this map is important (what it is trying to convey). Using the buttons in the sidebar, users can switch between viewing the distribution choropleth and the Social Housing Deficit Zones. The Housing Units dataset can be toggled on and off on both the choropleth view and the Social Housing Deficit Zone view. 

In addition to toggling between different datasets, while viewing the choropleth, users can click on each arrondissement to get information in pop-up form about each arrondissement's share of the city's social housing inventory.
