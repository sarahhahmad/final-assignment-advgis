This repository contains the HTML, Javascript, CSS, and relevant data for this interactive webmap which shows the distribution of the social housing stock in the arrondissements of Paris.  


This map is based on the data and static maps from [Apur: L'atelier parisien d'urbanisme (Paris Urban Agency)](https://www.apur.org/fr), specifically the [Map of social housing in Paris - Situation on 1st January 2019](https://www.apur.org/en/our-works/map-social-housing-paris-situation-1st-january-2019)

Future updates will:  

* INCLUDE ADDING A LEGEND!! (completely forgot this very key step)  
* Improve upon the map's style, including functionality of pop-ups  
* Include layers that include the building footprints of the social housing stock so that users can zoom in and see the distribution of social housing within arrondissements or at a more local scale.  
* Inlcude layers that identify the arrondissements that have lower concentrations of social housing to identify as target neighborhoods for future social housing construction.  
* Include layers that have the [Quartiers prioritaires de la politique de la ville 2024-2030](https://www.apur.org/sites/default/files/documents/cartefichiers-attaches/carte_qpv_grand_paris.pdf?token=gjJIUYAY), or the Priority Urban Neighborhoods for 2024-2030. These neighborhoods are identified as facing socioeconomic challenges such as socio-spatial segregation, for example.
