                     The <a href="https://www.ecologie.gouv.fr/loi-solidarite-et-renouvellement-urbain-sru">Law
                                on
                                Solidarity and Urban Renewal (SRU)</a>, first passed in 2000, set a target for
                            municipalities
                            in France of a certain size to “achieve a percentage of social rental housing among the
                            total
                            number
                            of main residences." The first iteration of the law set the target percentage of social
                            rental
                            housing to 20%, which was then updated in the 2013 iteration of the law to 25% (with 2025 as
                            the
                            deadline to achieve this). 
                        <p>Paris, being the largest city in France, is also held to this target. In fact, the City of
                            Paris
                            adopted the “Development and Renovation of the Housing Stock by 2035” strategy, which
                            creates a 30%
                            target for social housing. </p>

                                        available data.</a> While Paris is on track to achieve its social housing goals
                                    and
                                    continues to
                                    set higher targets for itself than is required nationally, there have been
                                    criticisms of the inequities in distribution of the social housing stock within
                                    Paris.
                                    Social
                                    housing units are disproportionately concentrated in the outer, eastern
                                    arrondissements (or,
                                    districts) or Paris, while the central and western arrondissements contain a much
                                    smaller
                                    share of
                                    the city’s social housing stock. </p>
                                In addition to building more social housing, the City of Paris seeks to reduce
                                spatial inequities in the distribution of social housing, along with reducing
                                concentrations of poverty. As such, mapping the existing distribution of social
                                housing can show existing conditions, and aid in holding the city accountable in
                                identifying sites for future social housing construction within the Social Housing
                                Deficit Zones.
